## Overview
This project represents my personal portfolio website, a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey. Built with cutting-edge web technologies, it demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development and design. The website has garnered significant attention, attracting over 100 visitors within just 10 days of its launch.

## Technologies Used
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites. Next.js was chosen for its excellent performance, SEO benefits, and ease of deployment.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript was used to enhance code quality, provide better documentation, and catch errors early in the development process.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Tailwind CSS allowed for quick styling and ensured consistency across the site.

- **[GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)**: A professional-grade JavaScript animation library. GSAP was utilized to create smooth, complex animations that enhance the user experience.

- **[Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis)**: A smooth scrolling library that provides a native-like scrolling experience. Lenis was integrated to improve the overall feel of the website.

- **[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)**: A client-side JavaScript library for sending emails directly from your web application. EmailJS powers the contact form, allowing visitors to reach out easily.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

2. **Dynamic Content**: Project showcases and skill sections are dynamically generated, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

3. **Smooth Scrolling and Animations**: Implemented using Lenis and GSAP, creating a polished and engaging user experience.

4. **Interactive UI Elements**: Custom-designed buttons, hover effects, and transitions that respond to user interactions.

5. **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form using EmailJS, allowing visitors to send messages directly from the website.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging Next.js features like Image Optimization and Code Splitting to ensure fast load times.

7. **SEO Friendly**: Utilizes Next.js's built-in features and best practices to enhance search engine visibility.

## Design Process
The design of this portfolio was meticulously crafted using Figma. The process involved:

1. **Conceptualization**: Initial brainstorming and mood boarding to define the overall look and feel.

2. **Wireframing**: Creating low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic layout and structure.

3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**: Developing detailed mockups in Figma, including color schemes, typography, and custom UI elements.

4. **Prototyping**: Creating interactive prototypes to test user flows and animations before implementation.

5. **Design System**: Establishing a consistent design system including color palettes, typography scales, and reusable components.

## Implementation Details
1. **Next.js and TypeScript Setup**: Configured a Next.js project with TypeScript for type-safe development.

2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Custom configuration of Tailwind CSS to match the design system created in Figma.

3. **Animation Implementation**: Utilized GSAP for complex animations, including page transitions and scroll-triggered effects.

4. **Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated Lenis for a smooth scrolling experience across all devices.

5. **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routing for project showcases, allowing for easy addition of new projects.

6. **Email Integration**: Set up EmailJS to handle form submissions securely without a backend.

7. **Deployment**: Deployed the application on Vercel, taking advantage of their analytics and performance optimization features.
